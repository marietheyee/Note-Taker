# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a Notes app that would enable users to write notes and save them until they are ready to be deleted.  In order to get this app working, we need to build the back end of the app to the already-existing front end, and then deploy it to Heroku, a live repository.

The applicationâ€™s front end has already been created. It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

## How to Install and Run the Project

First, install npm i and create Heroku in the terminal. If you already have Heroku installed and still need to make edits to your pages, you can still push your changes to Heroku by typing in git push Heroku main.

After you've pushed your final edits to Heroku, an address to a live server website will appear. Copy and paste the url to the web, and the Notes page will appear. Click on the Get Started button, and a blank note template will appear, ready for the user to type a note.
